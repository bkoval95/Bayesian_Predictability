# Bayesian-Reconciliation-of-the-Return-Predictability.

Code:
1) start_IN.R - the main file that loads all required packages and functions (from functions_IN.R). Please run first.
2) functions_IN.R - the file contains the necessary functions to replicate the results.
3) sim_data_IN.R - the file contains the code to replicate the simulated data and to create the raw results.
4) real_data_IN.R - the file contains the code to construct the empirical data set, perform Bayesian parameter estimation and testing.
5) figures_IN.R - the file contains the code to replicate figures and tables provided in the paper.

Data:
1) real_data - the folder that contains the raw real data and the results obtained for the real world data.
2) sim_data - the folder that contains the results for the simulated data.
3) EViews - the folder that contains the results for Table 9 where we used the EViews package.
